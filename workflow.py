# TODO: It would be neat to read task comments and types and display these in a UI graph (if a UI is ever built)
# TODO: Maybe we can "inject" deps into the task i.e. create some kind of simple built in DI framework
# TODO: A task should be able to retry
# TODO: For more fine grained control, it would be good if a task could be run on the ThreadPool or ProcessPool
# TODO: A task should have a "STATE" handler: e.g. could call another function
# @task(deps=[])
# @task should register this function as a task
